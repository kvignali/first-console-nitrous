# Using the Nitrous console

## Opening Nitrous

Nitrous is the cloud-based development environment you'll be using to write code on Learn. It's really easy to Nitrous from a lesson on Learn: just click the Open button. The Nitrous development environment will load in its own browser window, and is composed of two main sections: (1) a text editor and (2) your console. 

## Nitrous text editor

The top part of the Nitrous UI (SCREENSHOT) has a file browser on the left side, which allows you to navigate the directory structure of your container to find the files you need. When you open a file, you're able to edit its contents in the main window on the right hand side. This is where you'll write your code. 

## Nitrous console

While the upper part of the screen is where you write code, the lower part of the screen (SCREENSHOT) is called the console, or command line, and will be where you issue commands to your container instance. If you were using a Mac OSX environment, this command line is referred to as the "Terminal"â€”so if you ever hear people mention Terminal, this console is your equivalent in Nitrous. 

We'll soon cover how to enter commands into the console that will allow you open, test and submit code.
